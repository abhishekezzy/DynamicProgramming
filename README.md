# DynamicProgramming

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming:
1) Overlapping Subproblems
2) Optimal Substructure

### 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Solution:
For every item, you can either include the item in the Knapsack or exclude it. Thus to get the maximum value obtained by selecting out of n items, we need to compute the maximum of the following two values:
1. ( Including the n'th item ) Value of the n'th item plus the maximum value obtained from (n - 1) items and excluding the weight of n'th item. 
2. (Excluding the n'th item) Maximum value obtained from (n - 1) items. 
If weight of the n'th item is greater than total weight, then n'th item is excluded. (Case 2)
